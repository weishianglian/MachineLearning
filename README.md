## Machine Learning
* Use of "intelligent" techniques for analysis and processing of signals and data.  

Applications include:
* Spam Filtering
* Stock market prediction
* Autonomous vehicles
* Medical diagnosis
* Search engines (google search, google image search)
* Speech recognition
* News grouping, Ad placement
* Netflix recommendations

## A Few Quotes
* "A breakthrough in machine learning would be worth ten Microsofts" (Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft)
* "Machine learning is the next Internet" (Tony Tether, former director, DARPA)
* "Machine learning is the hot new thing" (John Hennessy, President, Stanford)
* "Web rankings today are mostly a matter of machine learning" (Prabhakar Raghavan, former Dir. Research, Yahoo)
* "Machine learning is going to result in a real revolution" (Greg Papadopoulos, former CTO, Sun)

## Examples
* Classification
    * Spam Filtering
    * Face dectection
* Regression
    * Stock market prediction
    * Facial landmark localisation
* Clustering
    * Clustering images
    * CLsutering documents
* Ranking
    * Text-based search
    * Visual search - find similiar images
* Recommendation
    * Recommendation system

## Type of Learning Problems
* Supervised Learning
    * Regression, Classification
* Unsupervisied Learning
    * Clustering
* Reinforcement Learning
    * Policy learning

## Think of the whole of **Machine Learning** like this
* Feature Selection: Pre-process the data based on domain specific/expert knowledge.
* Model: Choose a machine to make the prediction using these features.
* Cost Function: Write an equation that describes how good or bad your model is doing.
* Minimize cost function: Write an algorithm to minimize/maximize your cost function, preferably provably so.
* Generalization: Check that you have not overfitted or underfitted the data, e.g. the football predicting octopus.

## Techniques
* Probability and Random Variables
* Neural Networks
* Bayesian Inference
* Clustering
* Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
* Principal Components Analysis, Independent Component Analysis
