## Linear Regression
### Linear Regression with One Variable
In this exercise, we have one variable, X, and we building a model to predict one output, Y.  
The main program will be run from mllab1.m. Your first task is to run the main file.  
You will see a graph open displaying the changing gradient of your hypothesis. When gradient descent has finished press ‚Äúenter‚Äù to load the graph displaying the cost obtained with the theta values used at each iteration. Both the hypothesis and the cost graph will be flat because we need to calculate our hypothesis. For one variable linear regression, the hypothesis function is:  

![equation 1.1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$h_\theta(x)&space;=&space;\theta_0x_0&plus;\theta_1x_1$$)
where ùë•0 is the bias term and is set to 1 for all training examples.
